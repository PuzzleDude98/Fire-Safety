<br>
Fire extinguishers are also bad. Not only will you have a grease fire, now you just shot it across the room and into the wall!
<br>
The proper protocall is to simply to cover the fire with a lid or another pan untill it is fully extinguished.

Oven fires are much the same. Just close the door. Than Dance.
